title: Nintendo Switch - My Thoughts On Its UI + Hardware  
---

  I've had my Nintendo switch for a few years now, and this seemed like a great opportunity to get some thoughts out about, well, how much I love it. There have been some issues that I've faced since I first bought it, but overall, the Switch makes up for it in more ways than one. Nintendo did an amazing job creating an interface that allows for impressive navigation and control, and the hardware makes for an extremely portable/accessible device.

## Display

  Nintendo made it so that the Switch has multiple display options: directly on the Switch console (handheld or on its kickstand) or on an external device connected to the Switch via the dock. Having looked into it, interestingly, Nintendo chose to use a single UI across the different display types as opposed to maintaining multiple UI's. This may have been a compromising move considering the overlapping constraints between different displays, but Nintendo seemed to handle it pretty well. By slightly overscaling the UI, buttons are clearly defined and text, where it is present, is legible across various display options, such as a larger screen or when the Switch is on its kickstand, which would mean being farther away from the screen than you would be playing handheld. Text is used minimally and icons are predominantly used in their place so as to make for quick navigation, but text is present if you hover over icons, handling any ambiguity one may have with the icon symbols. 

## Input 

  The Switch offers multiple input options, touch screen and various controller modes. Touch screen makes for a much quicker  experience in the case that a user is faced with typing, whereas without touch screen, the user must navigate the keyboard through the controllers. The different controller modes appeal to a number of user preferences in terms of controller types. One can use the Joy Cons as they are while connected to the switch, or remove them from the switch and play sideways or upright, which can make for a more enjoyable experience with motion-based games. One can also connect a pro controller, which one might be more comfortable with or have a better grip on. Personally, I've had an issue with the Joy Cons known as the analog stick drift issue, which often occurs when dust gets underneath the analog stick base. This issue was common among switch users, most likely due to the console's portability, making it more subject to dust particles or dirt if one plays outside. It was pretty easily fixable using a Q-tip and some compressed air, though I can see how one might be worried about ruining the controller by taking it into their own hands. Overall, if you take your Switch outside often, make sure to clean around the analog stick base using dry materials, and it may help prevent the issue from happening to you. 

## Speed 

  One last notable attribute of the Switch, perhaps the most impressive, (saving the best for last), is its speed in regards to user input. Seconds after pressing the power button, the Switch turns on. Compared to other gaming consoles, such as the PS4, which can take a minute or so to turn on, this is extremely fast. In addition, system updates take only a few seconds, whereas, other gaming consoles, again, such as the PS4, would take several minutes. Picking up where you left off in a game takes mere seconds as well. The system responds extremely quickly to button presses, and everything is animated in such a way that gives the user an extremely smooth experience. 
  
Overall, I hope this gave you some insight into my thoughts on the UI/hardware of the Nintendo Switch. I can't wait to see how the company makes advancements going forward, and can only hope that they won't follow the path of some other game systems, where attempted improvements only made the UI complex for worse.
