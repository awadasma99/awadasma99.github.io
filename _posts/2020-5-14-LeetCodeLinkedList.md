title: Working Through Some Linked List LeetCode Problems 
---

In one of my previous posts, titled "Interview Prep," I mentioned that I had run through a number of LeetCode problems of various kinds in preparation for an interview. In this post, I plan to go through some Linked List problems, noting the steps I took along the way. 

## Problem 1 

*Reverse a singly Linked List* 

    Example: 
    
    Input: 1->2->3->4->5->NULL
    Output: 5->4->3->2->1->NULL

*A linked list can be reversed either iteratively or recursively. Could you implement both?*
