title: Working Through Some LeetCode Problems 
---

In one of my previous posts, titled "Interview Prep," I mentioned that I had gone through a number of LeetCode problems in preparation for a technical interview. In this post, I'll go through a few of them, noting the steps I took and what I learned from them. 

## Problem 1 

Given a binary tree, return the inorder traversal of its nodes' values.

    Input: [1, null, 2, 3] 
    
      1
       \
        2
       /
      3 
      
    Output: [1, 3, 2]
