title: Java VS JavaScript 
---

Java and JavaScript— two programming languages that sound so similar, yet couldn't be more different— well, that might be a stretch. They do have things in common, but Java and JavaScript are pretty different, despite the names, and I thought it might be interesting and a learning experience for myself to look into and highlight their similarities and differences. 

## Java 

+ For one thing, Java is compiled, or converted into bytecode, before it is executed. Think of it as translating what we understand, as humans, into what computers can read and understand. 
+ Second, Java is an Object Oriented Programming language— an approach based on the concept of "objects," complete with state and/or behavior, and how they relate to and interact with each other. 
+ Third, Java is statically typed, meaning that variables are known during compilation. This helps catch and pinpoint errors early in development. 

## JavaScript
