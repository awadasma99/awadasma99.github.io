title: Java VS JavaScript 
---

Java and JavaScript— two programming languages that sound so similar, yet couldn't be more different— well, that might be a stretch. They do have things in common, but Java and JavaScript are pretty different, despite the names, and I thought it might be interesting and a learning experience for myself to look into and highlight their similarities and differences. 

## Java 

+ For one thing, Java is compiled, or converted into bytecode, before it is executed. Think of it as translating what we understand, as humans, into what computers can read and understand. 
+ Second, Java is an Object Oriented Programming (OOP) language— it utilizes the Object Oriented paradigm, an approach based on the concept of "objects," complete with state and/or behavior, and how they relate to and interact with each other. It is a programming language because, again, it is compiled before it is executed. 
+ Third, Java is statically typed, meaning that variables are known during compilation. This helps catch and pinpoint errors early in development. 

## JavaScript 

+ JavaScript, on the other hand, is an interpreted language. It is interpreted in real time, with no preceding compilation. There's no class file dedicated to bytecode that is created. 
+ JavaScript utilizes OOP as well, but as a scripting language, meaning that, as previously mentioned, it isn't compiled. 
+ Next, JavaScript is dynamically typed, therefore variables are known at execution time. While this does allow for faster programming, it does sacrifice catching errors early in development, as seen with Java.
