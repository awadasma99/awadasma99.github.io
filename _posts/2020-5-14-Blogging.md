title: Blogging With Jekyll; Writing in Markdown
---

Thus far, I've been blogging using Jekyll, a website generator designed to create blogs hosted by Github Pages. I chose to set up a blog using the quickest method, forking a starting point (credit to Barry Clark), for the sake of time. I do, however, plan to look into setting one up from scratch on my own time using Jekyll from the command line. It seems like something I'd enjoy doing and a project that I'd learn a lot from. Having said that, what I've taken most from this experience is writing in Markdown.
