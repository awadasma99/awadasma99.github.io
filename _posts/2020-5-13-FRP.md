title: Functional Reactive Programming 
---

As part of an extra project I've done for this course, I picked up on some Elm, a bleeding edge language used for declaratively creating web browser-based graphical user interfaces. It's purely functional, and is developed with emphasis on usability, performance, and robustness. 

Now, as new as Elm was to me in terms of syntax and semantics, the functional programming paradigm was new to me as well. I thought I'd share some information I found useful to me in terms of understanding this paradigm, particularly regarding a sect of the paradigm called *Functional Reactive Programming*.
